Task_A.py consists of a SVM model and Task_B.py consists of a CNN model. 
Figures generated within the code are saved in the plots folder for each task. 
The dataset folder holds the pneumoniamnist.npz and pathmnist.npz for task A and B respectively. 
The .gitignore file prevents unnecessary files from being uploaded.
Both task A and B can be run at once using main.py.
All packages installed in the virtual environement is listed in requirement.txt
